"This program assumes the following values are given  (head loss, diameter of the pipe, length of the pipe, absolute roughness)"

 This program calculates the relative roughness and Reynolds number from the users assumed value of f.
 This then prompts the user to check their moody diagram using the calculated Reynolds number and relative roughness.
 If the user's calculated Reynolds number is within the given range for the given friction factor, the program will output the calculated Reynolds number and the corresponding Moody chart number.
 If the user's calculated Reynolds number is outside the given range, the program will output a message indicating that the given friction factor is not suitable for the given conditions.
 This then prompts the user again with a new calculated Reynolds Number from the new value of friction factor(f) obtained from the moody diagram.
 The program continues this process until it finds a suitable friction factor(f) which satisfies the given conditions.
